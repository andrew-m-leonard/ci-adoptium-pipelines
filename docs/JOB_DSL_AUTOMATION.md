# Job DSL Automation

This document describes how Jenkins pipeline jobs are created and updated using Job DSL scripts that read configuration from a vendor-specific configuration repository.

## Overview

All Jenkins pipeline jobs are defined as code using Job DSL scripts. A seed **Pipeline** job reads these scripts and creates/updates all launch and platform build jobs automatically. This ensures jobs are reproducible and version-controlled.

**Key points**:
- The seed job is a Jenkins **Pipeline** job using "Pipeline from SCM" — it points at a `Jenkinsfile.seed` that the vendor places in their config repo.
- A template `Jenkinsfile.seed` is provided at [`ci/jenkins/job-dsl/seed/Jenkinsfile.seed`](../ci/jenkins/job-dsl/seed/Jenkinsfile.seed) — copy it into your config repo and adjust as needed.
- Credentials for both repositories are managed entirely by the Jenkins Credentials store — nothing is placed on agents manually.
- The seed job does **not** regenerate itself. It is a permanent, manually configured Pipeline job.

## Prerequisites

Your Jenkins instance must have:

1. **Job DSL Plugin** installed and configured
2. **Pipeline Plugin** installed
3. **Git Plugin** installed
4. **Script Security** configured to allow Job DSL scripts
5. Access to:
   - `https://github.com/adoptium/ci-adoptium-pipelines.git` (pipeline code)
   - Your vendor-specific configuration repository

## Architecture

```
openjdk-build-seed-job  (Pipeline job — Pipeline from SCM → config repo Jenkinsfile.seed)
  │
  ├─ Pipeline SCM checkout: vendor config repo → workspace root
  │    vendor-scripts/*.params.json visible at workspace root
  │
  ├─ stage('Checkout pipeline repo')
  │    git checkout ci-adoptium-pipelines → pipelines/
  │
  └─ stage('Generate jobs')  [jobDsl step]
       pipelines/ci/jenkins/job-dsl/seed/seed_job_consolidated.groovy
         reads adoptium_pipeline_config.json   (active JDK versions, repo URLs)
         reads jenkins_job_config.json         (log rotation, default params)
         reads pipelines/scripts/stages/       (default stage params)
         reads vendor-scripts/                 (vendor stage param overrides)
         creates Build_openjdk_launchers/ folder + one launch job per JDK version
         creates Build_openjdk/ folder + Jenkins views

Build_openjdk_launchers/Build_openjdk21_launch  (Pipeline — Jenkinsfile.launch)
  reads configurations/jdk21_pipeline_config.json  (available platforms)
  if REGENERATE_JOBS=true (or build #1):
    jobDsl → openjdk_build_pipeline.groovy
      creates Build_openjdk/Build_openjdk21_temurin_x86-64_linux  etc.
  triggers all selected platform builds in parallel
```

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Copy the Jenkinsfile.seed template into your config repo

Copy [`ci/jenkins/job-dsl/seed/Jenkinsfile.seed`](../ci/jenkins/job-dsl/seed/Jenkinsfile.seed)
from this repo into the **root of your vendor config repository** (or any path you prefer):

```
<your-config-repo>/
  Jenkinsfile.seed          ← copied from this template
  adoptium_pipeline_config.json
  jenkins_job_config.json
  vendor-scripts/
    02-build.params.json
    ...
```

Open the file and adjust the two constants at the top if needed:

```groovy
def PIPELINES_REPO_URL    = 'https://github.com/adoptium/ci-adoptium-pipelines.git'
def PIPELINES_REPO_BRANCH = 'main'
```

For a fork or a pinned branch, change these values. Commit and push.

### Step 2: Create the Pipeline seed job in Jenkins

1. In Jenkins, create a new **Pipeline** job named `openjdk-build-seed-job`

2. **Add Parameters** — click *This project is parameterized* and add two String Parameters **in the Jenkins job configuration UI**:

   | Name | Default | Description |
   |---|---|---|
   | `CONFIG_REPO_URL` | *(your config repo URL)* | URL of your vendor config repository — **REQUIRED** |
   | `CONFIG_REPO_BRANCH` | `main` | Branch of your vendor config repository |

   > **Important**: do not declare these in `Jenkinsfile.seed`. A `parameters {}` block in a Jenkinsfile causes Jenkins to reset values to the Jenkinsfile defaults on every run, wiping whatever the operator set.

   These values are baked into every generated launch job so `Jenkinsfile.launch` can check out the config repo at runtime on each build agent.

3. Under **Pipeline**:
   - **Definition**: `Pipeline script from SCM`
   - **SCM**: Git
   - **Repository URL**: your vendor config repo URL
   - **Credentials**: select a Jenkins-managed credential if the repo is private
   - **Branch Specifier**: your config repo branch (e.g. `main`)
   - **Script Path**: `Jenkinsfile.seed` *(or the path you chose in Step 1)*

4. Save the job.

> **Note**: The Pipeline SCM step checks out the vendor config repo to the workspace
> root, so `adoptium_pipeline_config.json`, `jenkins_job_config.json`,
> `configurations/`, and `vendor-scripts/` are all immediately available to the Job
> DSL script without any additional checkout steps. Credentials are handled natively
> by the Git plugin using the Jenkins Credentials store.

### Step 3: Run the seed job

1. Click **Build with Parameters**
2. Set `CONFIG_REPO_URL` to your config repo URL (e.g. `https://github.com/adoptium/ci-temurin-config.git`)
3. Set `CONFIG_REPO_BRANCH` to your branch (e.g. `main`)
4. Click **Build**

The job will:
- Check out `ci-adoptium-pipelines` into `pipelines/`
- Collate stage parameters from `pipelines/scripts/stages/` and `vendor-scripts/`
- Read `adoptium_pipeline_config.json` and `jenkins_job_config.json` from the config repo
- Create the `Build_openjdk_launchers/` and `Build_openjdk/` folders
- Create one launch job per enabled JDK version under `Build_openjdk_launchers/`
- Create `Build_openjdk_launchers` and `Build_openjdk` Jenkins views

### Step 4: Create Platform Build Jobs

Run a launch job (e.g. `Build_openjdk_launchers/Build_openjdk21_launch`) with `REGENERATE_JOBS=true`.
It will create platform jobs like:
- `Build_openjdk/Build_openjdk21_temurin_x86-64_linux`
- `Build_openjdk/Build_openjdk21_temurin_aarch64_mac`

Platform jobs are also automatically created on the first run of each launch job (build #1).

## Configuration

### Active JDK Versions

Active versions are defined in `adoptium_pipeline_config.json` in the config repo:

```json
{
  "activeJdkVersions": [
    { "version": "jdk21", "enabled": true },
    { "version": "jdk17", "enabled": true },
    { "version": "jdk11", "enabled": false }
  ],
  "configFilePrefix": "configurations/",
  "configFileSuffix": "_pipeline_config.json"
}
```

The seed reads enabled entries and creates one launch job per version.

### Stage Parameters

Stage parameters are collated at seed-job time from two sources:

1. **Default params** — `pipelines/scripts/stages/*.params.json` (from `ci-adoptium-pipelines`)
2. **Vendor overrides** — `vendor-scripts/*.params.json` (from the vendor config repo, checked out to workspace root by the Pipeline SCM step)

Vendor files can add new parameters, replace defaults, or suppress defaults via `ignoreDefaultParams`.
The collated set is baked into every launch job and platform build job, with a hidden
`STAGE_PARAM_NAMES` meta-parameter that `Jenkinsfile.launch` uses to forward all stage
params to platform builds automatically.

### Job Parameters

Default parameter values come from `jenkins_job_config.json` in the config repo:

```json
{
  "pipelineTimeoutHours": 8,
  "jobConfiguration": {
    "defaultParameters": {
      "RUN_TESTS": false,
      "ENABLE_INSTALLERS": true,
      "SIGN_ARTIFACTS": false,
      "PUBLISH_ARTIFACTS": false,
      "RUN_REPRODUCIBLE_COMPARE": false,
      "CLEAN_WORKSPACE_AFTER_STAGE": true
    },
    "logRotation": {
      "daysToKeep": 30,
      "numToKeep": 50,
      "artifactDaysToKeep": 7,
      "artifactNumToKeep": 10
    }
  }
}
```

## Maintenance

### Re-running the Seed Job

Run the seed job any time to pick up changes to:
- Active JDK versions (`adoptium_pipeline_config.json`)
- Default parameters or log rotation (`jenkins_job_config.json`)
- Stage parameter definitions (`scripts/stages/*.params.json` or `vendor-scripts/*.params.json`)
- Job DSL script changes (`ci/jenkins/job-dsl/`)

The config repo is re-checked out by the Pipeline SCM step; `pipelines/` (ci-adoptium-pipelines) is re-checked out by the explicit `git` step in `Jenkinsfile.seed`.

### Adding/Removing JDK Versions

1. Edit `adoptium_pipeline_config.json` in the config repo — set `"enabled": false` or add a new entry
2. Commit and push
3. Re-run the seed job

### Updating Platform Jobs

1. Edit `jenkins_job_config.json` in the config repo or the Job DSL scripts
2. Commit and push
3. Re-run the seed job, then run each launch job with `REGENERATE_JOBS=true`

### Updating Pipeline Code

Changes to `Jenkinsfile` files or stage scripts in `ci-adoptium-pipelines` take effect on the next platform build run — no seed job run needed.

### Pinning to a specific pipeline repo version

Edit the constants in your `Jenkinsfile.seed`:

```groovy
def PIPELINES_REPO_URL    = 'https://github.com/adoptium/ci-adoptium-pipelines.git'
def PIPELINES_REPO_BRANCH = 'v2.1.0'   // pin to a tag or branch
```

Commit and push, then re-run the seed job.

## Troubleshooting

### Seed Job Fails with "CONFIG_REPO_URL is required"

**Cause**: Seed job run without parameters.

**Fix**: Use **Build with Parameters** and supply `CONFIG_REPO_URL` and `CONFIG_REPO_BRANCH`.

### Seed Job Fails with "vendor-scripts/ not found"

**Cause**: The `vendor-scripts/` directory does not exist in the workspace root.

**Fix**: Verify that your config repo contains a `vendor-scripts/` directory. The Pipeline SCM step checks out the config repo to the workspace root — if `vendor-scripts/` is missing from the repo, create it and add at least a placeholder `*.params.json` file (can be one with empty `parameterGroups`).

### Seed Job Fails with "adoptium_pipeline_config.json / jenkins_job_config.json not found"

**Cause**: One of the required JSON files is missing from the vendor config repo root.

**Fix**: Verify that both `adoptium_pipeline_config.json` and `jenkins_job_config.json` exist at the root of the config repo.

### Seed Job Fails with "Script Security"

**Cause**: Jenkins Script Security is blocking Job DSL operations.

**Fix**: Go to **Manage Jenkins → In-process Script Approval** and approve the required signatures.

### Launch Job Doesn't Show All Platforms

**Cause**: The `PLATFORMS` choice parameter is populated at seed-job time. Platforms added to the config after the last seed run will not appear.

**Fix**: Re-run the seed job.

### Platform Jobs Not Created / Out of Date

**Cause**: `REGENERATE_JOBS` was not set, or this is not build #1.

**Fix**: Run the launch job with `REGENERATE_JOBS=true`.
