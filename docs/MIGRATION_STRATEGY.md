# Migration Strategy: Legacy to Modularized Declarative Pipeline

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic approach for migrating from the legacy monolithic Jenkins pipeline to a new modularized declarative pipeline architecture. The migration follows a phased, incremental rollout strategy designed to minimize risk while ensuring continuous validation and the ability to rollback at any point.

**Total Duration**: 20 weeks (approximately 5 months)
**Approach**: Incremental, platform-by-platform rollout
**Validation**: Reproducible build comparison at each phase
**Risk Mitigation**: Parallel operation with legacy, rollback capability

## Migration Principles

### 1. Incremental Rollout
Start with a single platform (Linux x64) and progressively expand to all platforms. Each platform is validated independently before moving to the next.

### 2. Parallel Operation
Run new pipelines alongside legacy pipelines for validation. Legacy continues to publish while new pipelines are validated, ensuring no disruption to releases.

### 3. Reproducibility Verification
Use `repro_compare.sh` tooling to validate that new pipeline builds are byte-for-byte identical to legacy builds, ensuring no regression in build quality.

### 4. Risk Mitigation
Each phase has clear success criteria and rollback procedures. If issues arise, the system can revert to legacy operation while problems are resolved.

### 5. Automation First
Generate pipeline jobs from configuration files rather than manual creation, enabling rapid deployment of new platforms and reducing human error.

### 6. EA Builds as Testbed
Use Early Access (EA) builds as the validation environment before switching production General Availability (GA) builds to the new pipeline.

## Conclusion

This migration strategy provides a structured, low-risk approach to transitioning from the legacy monolithic pipeline to the new modularized declarative pipeline architecture. The strategy emphasizes:

1. **Incremental Progress**: Start small, expand gradually
2. **Continuous Validation**: Verify at each step
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Rollback capability at every phase
4. **Reproducibility**: Ensure builds match legacy
5. **Automation**: Generate jobs from configuration
6. **Parallel Operation**: Run alongside legacy for validation

By following this strategy, the migration can be completed with minimal risk and maximum confidence in the new system. The phased approach allows for learning and adjustment at each step, while the parallel operation ensures no disruption to ongoing releases.

The 20-week timeline provides adequate time for thorough validation at each phase while maintaining steady progress toward the goal of a fully modularized, restartable, and maintainable pipeline infrastructure.
