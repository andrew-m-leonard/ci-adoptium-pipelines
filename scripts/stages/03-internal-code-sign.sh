# DEFAULT STUB: 03-internal-code-sign
#
# Code signs internal EXEs/DLLs and dylibs of jdk11+ JMODs, prior to build
# image assembly. Required because JMOD contents must be signed before the
# final JDK image is linked by the Assemble Images stage.
# Windows & Mac only. Not applicable to jdk8.
#
# Override this stub by placing a script at:
#   config-repo/vendor-scripts/03-internal-code-sign.{sh,groovy,py}
#
# Required Environment Variables (for vendor implementations):
#   WORKSPACE             - Stage workspace directory
#   CONFIG_FILE           - Path to pipeline-config.json
#   INPUT_ARTIFACTS_DIR   - Directory containing jmods from Build stage
#   TARGET_DIR            - Directory for signed jmod output
